A web based application that aims at providing women safety and fulfil basic needs of women
# Introduction
A web-based application to help in providing safety for women across India. The application has features such as finding the safest route to a place, sharing location and calling family members and emergency centers in case of an emergency, finding help in case of violence and more such features that ensure women's safety. 
#Key functionalities
1. Three modes of Operation- Most women safety applications have the feature of calling help centres in case of emergency. However, what makes our functionality novel and different from the rest of the applications is that our app will have a calling and messaging facility as per the user’s situation. We plan to have three modes green, orange and red. Green mode if the user feels insecure but does not suspect anyone or nothing suspicious is happening around her, orange if the user suspects someone but the person has not taken any action and red if the user is under attack. Depending on what situation the user is and which mode she opts for, the following actions are taken:
      i.  Green mode- the location of the user is shared with the registered family members. 
      ii. Orange mode- the location of the user is shared with the registered family members along with a call. 
      iii. Red Mode- A call to the women's help centre is immediately made along with the user’s location. The location and a message is sent to the family members. 
2.Find Medical Shops within 2.5 km range: This functionality will provide the location of the nearest medical store to fulfil any medical needs.
3.Nearby Safest Routes: Display the safest route to a place. This assists the user to take busier roads while travelling and ensure their safety.
4. Find Hospitals within 2.5 km range: This functionality asks the user’s location and displays a map with all hospitals in the range of 2.5km. On clicking on the hospital marking on the map, the user is directed to google map’s page where the route to the hospital is displayed.
